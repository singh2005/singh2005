### 👋 Hey, I’m Shailendra

I like building things that make systems faster, smarter, and a little more fun. Most of my career has been in **monitoring, performance testing, and infrastructure engineering** — basically making sure apps don’t break when people actually use them.  

On here you’ll find a mix of:  
- 🛠️ Infra-as-Code projects (like [`newrelic-terraform-importer`](https://github.com/singh2005/newrelic-terraform-importer)), where I wrangled APIs + Terraform to tame messy monitoring setups.  
- 🤖 Side projects with personality, like [`scamurai-bot`](https://github.com/singh2005/scamurai-bot) and [`scamurai-website`](https://github.com/singh2005/scamurai-website), aimed at fighting online scams with a mix of AI + automation.  
- 📈 Experiments in system performance, backend design, and scaling — I once tuned a load testing setup to push **2M+ req/min** without catching fire.  
- 🚀 Random curiosities: AWS tinkering, Docker/K8s playgrounds, Python utilities, and soon… my attempt at iOS app dev.  

I enjoy learning by building — whether that’s automating an annoying manual process, or turning a “what if” idea into a working prototype.
